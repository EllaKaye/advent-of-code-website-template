This post is created by a call to aoc_new_day(1, 2022). It can be deleted with a call to aoc_delete_day(1, 2022), or all posts and the listing for the year can be deleted with aoc_delete_year(2022).\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(aochelpers)\ninput &lt;- aoc_input_vector(1, 2022, \"numeric\")\n\n\nI’m using the aoc_input_vector() function from the aochelpers package to read in the data, but otherwise using base R functions (including the native pipe, |&gt;) for this puzzle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is Ella Kaye’s solution1, with her puzzle input. If attempting this challenge yourself, your solution will be different.\n\n\nIn this challenge, we’re given groups of numbers and we need to find the sum of each group. Our solution is the largest of these. The groups are separated by a blank line. When reading in the input as a numeric vector, these are coerced to NA. We can identify the new groups by the NA values, produce an index for them with cumsum(is.na(input)), which increments when a new NA is reached, then use this with split() to split the input into a list of vectors, one for each group. We need the argument na.rm = TRUE in sapply() because each vector, other than the first, starts with NA, as that’s where it was split.\n\n\nCode\ntotals &lt;- split(input, cumsum(is.na(input))) |&gt; \n  sapply(sum, na.rm = TRUE) \n\nmax(totals)\n\n\n[1] 66719"

    "text": "Advent of Code is a series of increasingly difficult programming challenges, released daily each year throughout December in the run-up to Christmas.\nThis website is created from the EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template template repository.\nIt is built with Quarto and works hand-in-hand with the R package aochelpers. The package provides function to manage this website, e.g. to create new posts from a template, to download and read in the puzzle input, and will eventually include functions to help with the challenges themselves. See the package website for more details.\nAs part of the demo, this template comes with an example listing page and some example posts, which you can delete with aochelpers::aoc_delete_year(2022).\nThere are two built-in themes. The light theme is designed to be quite clean, with a Christmas green and red colours. The dark theme is designed to be reminiscent of the Advent of Code website (though not identical, since the design of https://adventofcode.com is part of its registered trademark). You can switch between them using the toggle in the top right corner of the page."
